# INTRODUCTION
This web application is made as a part of Microsoft Engage'21 as a solution to the challenge of making a Microsoft Teams Clone.Microsoft Teams is a proprietary business communication platform developed by Microsoft, as part of the Microsoft 365 family of products.

# Product Description:
# Background:
Microsoft Engage is an Engagement & Mentorship Program launched by Microsoft IDC aimed at giving students a chance to be mentored by Microsoft and be a part of AMA Sessions, Webinars and Leader talks delivered by Microsoft employees.This year's theme was Agile Methodology.
Agile development is a mindset whose values and principles provide guidance on how to create and respond to change and how to deal with uncertainty.

It is a way of dealing with, and ultimately succeeding in, an uncertain and turbulent environment. It's really about thinking through how you can understand what's going on in the environment that you're in today, identify what uncertainty you're facing, and figure out how you can adopt to that as you go along.Agile scrum methodology is a project management system that relies on incremental development. Each iteration consists of two- to four-week sprints, where each sprintâ€™s goal is to build the most important features first and come out with a potentially deliverable product. More features are built into the product in subsequent sprints and are adjusted based on stakeholder and customer feedback between sprints.
As a part of this journey, I developed a web application that allows video chat between different users.The users can also communicate with each other via sending messages to each other in a chat box.The prototype also supports the functionality to share a user's screen with the other participants & allows the users to start/stop their video & mute/unmute themselves.
